# Earthquake-Prediction
This project discusses a machine learning model that can predict the damage grade severity caused by life-threatening earthquake that hit Nepal in the year 2015. 

## Problem Statement
To establish a methodology that can assist in forecasting these earthquakes, as they can help prevent the severity of the damage.

Also trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:
represents low damage
represents a medium amount of damage
represents almost complete destruction

## ToolKit
numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
sklearn.ensemble for RandomForestClassifier
sklearn.tree for DecisionTreeClassifier
sklearn.metrics for precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score, accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
