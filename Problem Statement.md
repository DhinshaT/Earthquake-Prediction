### Problem Statement

1. To establish a methodology that can assist in forecasting these earthquakes, as they can help prevent the severity of the damage. 

2. Also trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:

    represents low damage
    
    represents a medium amount of damage
    
    represents almost complete destruction
