It's found that most of the buildings are partially damaged. Mainly depends on heights of the building, number of floors in the building, age of the building, surface condition of the land where building was built, type of foundation used,  type of roof, type of the ground floor, structure of the building made of etc

To make a building earthquake proof, it is important to put shear walls, a shear core and cross-bracing.

To conclude, a simple machine learning model that was able to properly classify the damage severity to the buildings caused by the life-threatening Gorkha earthquake was developed. 
In this project, a machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier algorithm  was built which was able to achieve the F1-score of 0.7295 (72.95%)
